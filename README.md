# CaptchaIdentifier
Image Captcha Solving Using TensorFlow and CNN Model，with self-labeling image Dataset，free to download my Dataset for  self-learning. accuracy 95%+.

&emsp;

Note:this implementation, in some way, is kind of  rough, but effective. hope to motivate your inspiration to do better work.

# DataSet

&emsp;&emsp;Happy to contribute the dataSet, images are from a real website, labling by tired  eyes and numb hands, so if you think it can do some kind of help,  star it. Thank you! download the data by [Baidu Pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iK3D0sDkbM6_u-LKpgs2Yg),

sharing code is: `oacx`，enjoy!
